Simple Open-Source UHF RFID Tag Platform

N. Barbot and P. Nikitin

This project is a simple low-cost SDR RFID UHF tag capable of being read by a UHF reader. This reader is designed around a simple envelope detector and a backscattering modulator. All tasks specific to the RFID protocol including clock recovery, data recovery and frame detection are handled in software by a Arduino Uno micro-controller. This tag is able to generate any RFID reply supported by the protocol and to decode any commands sent by a reader in real time.
