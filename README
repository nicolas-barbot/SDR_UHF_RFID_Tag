Simple Open-Source UHF RFID Tag Platform

N. Barbot and P. Nikitin

In this work, we present a simple open-source software-defined based UHF (RAIN) RFID tag that can be used for academic research. This work is a follow-up to the open-source reader work presented in [1]. The hardware associated with this tag is only composed of an envelope detector and an RF switch and uses a modular design. All operations related to the RFID protocol, which includes clock recovery, data recovery and frame synchronization are entirely realized in software and can be processed by an Arduino Uno platform. The purpose of this work is to encourage researchers and students to experiment with RAIN RFID technology, to understand its protocols and standards, and to improve the proposed tag design. All relevant files (including schematic and source code) will be released as open source to the community.
